WIGGLE - the ultimate firewall training tool

Wiggle is a firewall rule creation & management training tool developed as a Capstone project by college graduates in Cybersecurity.
The main function of this application is to provide a quick to install, easy to use application that allows students to explore the different components of a firewall and to understand how they work to secure computer systems. 
Wiggle provides a unique, hands-on learning experience that allows users of the program to apply any current knowledge they have of firewall rules & settings and expand upon that knowledge with immediate input feedback & messages.
